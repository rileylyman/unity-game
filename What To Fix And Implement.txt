	- Player Clips forwards sometimes while running at full speed (@001)
	- No transition animation functionality, i.e. when jumping it immediately defaults to idle when you land (@002)
	- The camera does not track the player properly in the y direction when they fall too fast  (@003)
	- When walking up slopes that are too sleep, the player flies up and/or assumes the jump animation (@004)
	- When dragging around items in the inventory, the sprites go back to normal size, or, if CursorMode.Auto is on, they appear very pixelated. (@005)
	- Dropped items do not fall to the floor (@006) [potental fix : keep x position as is. get y position of bottom of player and use that to set the y position of the sprite correctly]
	- You can jump out of the grab animation (@007)
	- Dropped objects float on sloped surfaces (@008)
	- You can jump during the pick-up animation (@009)
