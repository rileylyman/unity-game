	Fixed:
	- Dropped items do not fall to the floor (@006) 
	- You can jump out of the grab animation (@007) (@009) [was duplicated]
	- Dropped objects float on sloped surfaces (@008) 

	Active:
	- Player Clips forwards sometimes while running at full speed (@001)
	- No transition animation functionality, i.e. when jumping it immediately defaults to idle when you land (@002)
	- The camera does not track the player properly in the y direction when they fall too fast  (@003)
	- When walking up slopes that are too sleep, the player flies up and/or assumes the jump animation (@004)
	- When dragging around items in the inventory, the sprites go back to normal size, or, if CursorMode.Auto is on, they appear very pixelated. (@005)
	- Duplicate item confict issues: they misbehave in inventory and in itemPickup script (@010)
	- Movable objects sometime stop on incline changes, and you can lose them on slopes (@011)
