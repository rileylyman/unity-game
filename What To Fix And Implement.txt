	
BUGS:

	- Player Clips forwards sometimes while running at full speed (@001)
	- No transition animation functionality, i.e. when jumping it immediately defaults to idle when you land (@002)
	- The camera does not track the player properly in the y direction when they fall too fast  (@003)
	- When walking up slopes that are too sleep, the player flies up and/or assumes the jump animation (@004)
	- When dragging around items in the inventory, the sprites go back to normal size, or, if CursorMode.Auto is on, they appear very pixelated. (@005)
	- Dropped items do not fall to the floor (@006) [potental fix : keep x position as is. get y position of bottom of player and use that to set the y position of the sprite correctly]
	- You can jump out of the grab animation (@007)
	- Dropped objects float on sloped surfaces (@008)


TO IMPLEMENT:

	- Implement Animation Scripts [Done]
	- Player Movement [Done]
	- Camera Movement [Done]
	- Basic Physics [Done]
	- Create Basic Inventory [Done]
	- Add Collectables [Done]
	- Add Dropping support [Done]
	- Make Movable Objects [Done]
	- Drop objects to correct location (@006) [Done]
	- Rotate dropped objects to correct orientation [Done]
	
	- Physics objects rotate on inclines

	- Drag and Dropping
	- Menu UI and Tooltips for items
	- Saving and loading 
	- Allow Animation Transitions and Triggered Events
	- Make The Inventory persistent 
	- Interactable class : When player "uses" them, the game state changes
		- Interactables that are dependent on things in inventory
		- Interactables that are dependent on having completed other tasks
	- Add Consumables (food, water)
	- Add Equipables (Axe for collecting wood, Bow, etc.)
	- Add the game objects to the game
	- Add Music 
	- Add Sound effects for different surfaces
	- Audio
